# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

For this assignment,
I had to create an App that stored Employee Information using React. I started with creating a Table that housed all of the employee info such as name, phone and email.
I created Components that handled the state of the application each time the page rendered and responds to events made by the user.
